One of the many beauties of yoga is that you can do it just about anywhere! If you want to start an at-home yoga practice, first make sure you have a quiet place to flow with plenty of space to move around. Remove all distractions, like TVs, radios, phones, and other people. This is your relaxation sanctuary.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTest if you have enough room by holding your arms out and spinning around. If you don’t hit anything, you’re good to go!

Every body is different, so adapt your practice and flow in a way that makes you feel strong and empowered.\\n\\nFor instance, if you’re following a video that has a pose that’s uncomfortable in your body, modify it or go back to a previous pose.\\nIf you’ve tried one style of yoga and aren’t feeling it, try another to see if a different type of flow is better for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n   Mandy Ingber, Yoga Influencer Yoga is not about being perfect.

Find a quiet place to practice and lay out a yoga mat. Then, kneel on the mat with your feet together and your knees hip-width apart. Lower your torso between your legs and reach your arms forward toward the top of the mat to do child’s pose. When you feel relaxed and centered, come to your hands and knees with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Now, try downward-facing dog. Curl your toes under, lift your knees off the mat, and reach your pelvis up toward the ceiling, straightening your legs. Press into your hands and push your heels toward the ground. Hold the pose for a few deep breaths. Next, try walking your feet up toward your hands for forward fold pose. When you’re ready, slowly roll your upper body up until you’re standing in mountain pose. Take deep breaths and focus on your breathing as you move through different poses. Practice yoga as often as you can, even just 10 minutes a day will help you improve. You can also take a yoga class to learn new poses from a trained instructor, which will help you get better even faster.

One of the many beauties of yoga is that you can do it just about anywhere! If you want to start an at-home yoga practice, first make sure you have a quiet place to flow with plenty of space to move around. Remove all distractions, like TVs, radios, phones, and other people. This is your relaxation sanctuary.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTest if you have enough room by holding your arms out and spinning around. If you don’t hit anything, you’re good to go!

At-home yoga is great, especially when you’re just starting out, but there’s something even more special about flowing with other people. Try signing up for a yoga class at your local gym or yoga studio. Who knows? You may just make a few friends and learn something new!\\n\\nIf you’re unsure which class would best fit your skill level, call the studio or instructor and ask what they would suggest based on your experience.\\nIf you take a class and don’t like an instructor’s teaching style, that’s okay. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of classes out there to choose from, and you’ll find one that matches your needs—don’t give up![19]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Often Should You Practice Yoga?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExpert Q&A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\nAdd New Question\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion\\nWhen was yoga discovered? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tCaitlin Downey\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tYoga Instructor\\n\\nCaitlin Downey is a Registered Yoga Teacher at Yoga Therapy in Burlington, Vermont.

Find a quiet place to practice and lay out a yoga mat. Then, kneel on the mat with your feet together and your knees hip-width apart. Lower your torso between your legs and reach your arms forward toward the top of the mat to do child’s pose. When you feel relaxed and centered, come to your hands and knees with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Now, try downward-facing dog. Curl your toes under, lift your knees off the mat, and reach your pelvis up toward the ceiling, straightening your legs. Press into your hands and push your heels toward the ground. Hold the pose for a few deep breaths. Next, try walking your feet up toward your hands for forward fold pose. When you’re ready, slowly roll your upper body up until you’re standing in mountain pose. Take deep breaths and focus on your breathing as you move through different poses. Practice yoga as often as you can, even just 10 minutes a day will help you improve. You can also take a yoga class to learn new poses from a trained instructor, which will help you get better even faster. To learn more from our Yoga Instructor co-author, such as how to find a yoga class or instructor, keep reading the article!\\nDid this summary help you?YesNo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other languages\\nSpanish\\nItalian\\nRussian\\nGerman\\nIndonesian\\nDutch\\nFrench\\nCzech\\nJapanese\\nArabic\\nThai\\nVietnamese\\nChinese\\nHindi\\n\\n\\n\\nPrint\\nSend fan mail to authors\\n\\n\\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 441,876 times.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReader Success Stories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeronica Bruce\\nAug 21, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Thanks so much for the articles given here.
